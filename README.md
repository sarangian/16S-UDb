# 16S-UDb v1.0
A unified curated reference database for improving the taxonomic classification of bacteria using 16S rRNA sequence data

Files
16S-UDb v1.0 contains 16S rRNA gene sequences in fasta format (16S-UDb_sequences.fasta) 
and corresponding taxonomy text files in QIIME 1 compatible format
16S-UDb_MOTHUR_taxonomy.txt: to use with RDP na√Øve Bayesian classifier and MOTHUR classifier
16S-UDb_QIIME_taxonomy.txt: to use with all other classifiers in-built in QIIME (except RDP and MOTHUR)

NOTES:
The 16S-UDb taxonomy has six levels (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) 
in order to make it compatible with QIIME analysis pipeline
