# 16S-UDb v1.0
A unified curated reference database for improving the taxonomic classification of bacteria using 16S rRNA sequence data

<b>Files:</b>

16S-UDb v1.0 contains 16S rRNA gene sequences in fasta format (<i>16S-UDb_sequences.fasta</i>) 
and corresponding taxonomy text files in QIIME 1 compatible format.

<i>16S-UDb_MOTHUR_taxonomy.txt</i>: to use with RDP na√Øve Bayesian classifier and MOTHUR classifier.

<i>16S-UDb_QIIME_taxonomy.txt</i>: to use with all other classifiers in-built in QIIME (except RDP and MOTHUR)

<b>NOTES:</b>

The 16S-UDb taxonomy has six levels (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species) 
in order to make it compatible with QIIME analysis pipeline
